# EP-Finder
The script `fetchData()` facilitates searching and retrieving specific details of individuals from an API based on their name and displaying them in a Google Sheets spreadsheet named "Welcome". It begins by extracting a search query from cell J19 within the sheet. Subsequently, it sets up headers for an API request and sends a POST request to a GraphQL endpoint (`https://gis-api.aiesec.org/graphql`), passing the query to fetch data related to people matching the search criteria. Upon receiving the API response, the script parses the JSON data and focuses on key attributes such as email, full name, gender, phone number, status, referral type, alignment keywords, opportunity applications count, and rejection count. Finally, it populates cells D22 to M22 in the spreadsheet with the retrieved information, allowing for easy reference and analysis of matched individuals by name.
